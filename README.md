PROJECT LOG:
  - I have "PROJECT LOG" - file attached to the project. If you are interested for more information than just commits, please check it up! It's kind of diary, where       I've explained what I've done and when, what issues I had and how I solved them - day by day.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THE DATA SETS FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT:
  - I imported only one of three data sets to mongoDB, because it's free up to 512mb and there was lot of more data in those sets.
  - Deleted a lot of documents without coveredDistance field.
  - There was also lot of documents multiple times, I didn't do anything about it.
