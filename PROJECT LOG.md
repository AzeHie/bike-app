  - Project set up, started new project for react frontend and created server.js for nodeJS backend.

7.4.2023 
  - Imported data to the mongoDB. I had to edit headerline in notepad, because there was dot in "Duration (sec.) - field. That was converted to an object in mongoDB.       Also removed spaces from title's, to make data handling easier in my project.

8.4.2023
  - Added backend routing, error handling and models. Routes tested with POSTMAN.
  
9.4.2023
  - Working with journey-controllers on backend. Added sorting and pagination for data fetching, and possiblity to add new journeys. There was lot of new things for       me - and because of that it took awhile but I've learned lot of about pagination and sorting with mongoose. I decided to use query params in both cases (sorting       and pagination). Routes tested with POSTMAN and looks quite good, but let's see how it works within / from frontend too.

10.4.2023
  - Started working with frontend. Created folder structure, added components and pages. 

11.4.2023
  - Working with journeysList. Started working with routing, navigation.

12.4.2023
  - Finished routing / navigation and added app-wide styling. Working with journeysList and StationsList. I had some problems with props.children since there has been     some kind of update after I last time used it - but thankfully we have stackoverflow/youtube (:D). Atleast I know how to set type for that children prop nowadays.
